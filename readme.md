Second Life Shinto shrine register (SLSR)
=========================================


About
-----
The Second Life Shinto Shrine Register (SLSR) is a association of Shinto shrines in Second Life.


Intall notes:
-------------
* The database dump needs to be imported at first
* The application needs write access for the directory `/public/images/shrines/small`.
* The shrine images in `/public/images/shrines` needs to have the complete shrine name, with underscores instead of spaces, as file name (expecting *.png files).
